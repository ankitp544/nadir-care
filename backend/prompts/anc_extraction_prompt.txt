You will be analyzing an image of a Complete Blood Count (CBC) report to identify and extract the Absolute Neutrophil Count value.

Your task is to carefully examine this CBC report image and locate the Absolute Neutrophil Count value, which should be expressed in per microliter (μL) or per microliter equivalent units.

Here are important guidelines for completing this task:

- Look for terms such as "Absolute Neutrophil Count", "ANC", "Neutrophils (Absolute)", "Abs Neutrophils", or similar variations

- The value is typically expressed in units like "/μL", "/mcL", "per μL", "per microliter", "K/μL", or "×10³/μL"

- Pay attention to both the numerical value and its units

- CBC reports may have different layouts, so scan the entire document systematically

- Some reports may show neutrophils as both a percentage and an absolute count - you need the absolute count

- If there are multiple neutrophil-related values, focus specifically on the absolute count, not the percentage

Before providing your final answer, use the scratchpad below to work through your analysis:


After your analysis, provide your final answer in the following format:

If you successfully locate the Absolute Neutrophil Count:

<answer>

[numerical value] per microliter

</answer>

If you cannot locate the Absolute Neutrophil Count in the image:

<answer>

Absolute Neutrophil Count not found in this image

</answer>

If the image is unclear or unreadable:

<answer>

Image is too unclear to read the Absolute Neutrophil Count

</answer>
