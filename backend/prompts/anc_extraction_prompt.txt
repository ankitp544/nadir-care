You will be analyzing an image of a Complete Blood Count (CBC) report to identify and extract the Absolute Neutrophil Count value.

Your task is to carefully examine this CBC report image and locate the Absolute Neutrophil Count value, which should be expressed in per microliter (μL) or per microliter equivalent units.

Here are important guidelines for completing this task:

- Look for terms such as "Absolute Neutrophil Count", "ANC", "Neutrophils (Absolute)", "Abs Neutrophils", or similar variations

- The value is typically expressed in units like "/μL", "/mcL", "per μL", "per microliter", "K/μL", or "×10³/μL"

- Pay attention to both the numerical value and its units

- **CRITICAL: Handle number formats correctly:**
  - If the value is shown as "K/μL" (e.g., "2.03 K/μL"), multiply by 1000 to get the actual value (2.03 K/μL = 2030 per microliter)
  - If the value includes "×10³" or "×10^3", multiply the number by 1000 (e.g., "2.03 ×10³/μL" = 2030 per microliter)
  - If the value has a comma as a thousands separator (e.g., "2,030"), preserve it as 2030 (do not interpret the comma as a decimal point)
  - If the value appears as a whole number like "2030" or "2030.0", report it as 2030 (not 2.03)
  - Always report the final value in standard per microliter units (without multipliers like K or ×10³)

- CBC reports may have different layouts, so scan the entire document systematically

- Some reports may show neutrophils as both a percentage and an absolute count - you need the absolute count

- If there are multiple neutrophil-related values, focus specifically on the absolute count, not the percentage

- **Important:** When extracting the numerical value, ensure you preserve the full magnitude. For example, if you see "2030", "2,030", "2.03 K/μL", or "2.03 ×10³/μL", all should be reported as "2030 per microliter" (not "2.03 per microliter")

After your analysis, provide your final answer in the following format:

If you successfully locate the Absolute Neutrophil Count:

<answer>

[numerical value] per microliter

</answer>

If you cannot locate the Absolute Neutrophil Count in the image:

<answer>

Absolute Neutrophil Count not found in this image

</answer>

If the image is unclear or unreadable:

<answer>

Image is too unclear to read the Absolute Neutrophil Count

</answer>
